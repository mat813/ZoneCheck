To install ZoneCheck 2 (the executable is simply named zc), you will
need the Ruby environment and GNU Make (sometimes called gmake)

Ruby can be found as a package or port in every serious
Unix. Otherwise, see <URL:http://www.rubycentral.com/> and
<URL:http://www.ruby-lang.org/>

WARNING: you need the Ruby version 1.8.0 which is currently in the
preview stage and so it is possible that a binary package is not
available for your operating system (some 1.7.x version could be
enough, but no garantee are given)

Once Ruby is installed, just "make install" will install everything
somewhere under /usr/local. If you prefer another place, type "make
PREFIX=/some/where install".

The default hierarchie is:
PREFIX
|-- bin
|   `-- zc			# Command line
|-- etc
|   `-- zc.conf			# Configuration file
|-- libexec
|   `--zc
|      |-- cgi-bin
|      |   `-- zc.cgi		# CGI
|      |-- html			# HTML directory (javascript, css, pics, ...)
|      |   |-- en		#   English version
|      |   |-- ...              #   ...
|      |   `-- fr		#   French version
|      |-- locale		# Localisation files
|      |-- test			# test set
|      |-- lib			# Extra libraries (NResolv, Address, ...)
|      `-- zc			# core component
`-- share
    `-- doc
        `-- zc			# Documentation
