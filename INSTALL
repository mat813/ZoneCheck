To install ZoneCheck 2 (the executable is simply named zc), you will
need the Ruby environement and GNU Make (sometimes called gmake)

Ruby can be found as a package or port in every serious
Unix. Otherwise, see <URL:http://www.rubycentral.com/>.

Once Ruby is installed, just "make install" will install everything
somewhere under /usr/local. If you prefer another place, type "make
PREFIX=/some/where install".
