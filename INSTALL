To install ZoneCheck 2 (the executable is simply named zc), you will
need the Ruby environement and GNU Make (sometimes called gmake)

The following ruby packages are also needed:
 - text-format (<URL:http://www.halostatue.ca/ruby/Text__Format.html)

Ruby can be found as a package or port in every serious
Unix. Otherwise, see <URL:http://www.rubycentral.com/>.

Once Ruby is installed, just "make install" will install everything
somewhere under /usr/local. If you prefer another place, type "make
PREFIX=/some/where install".

The default hierarchie is:
PREFIX
|-- bin
|   `-- zc			# Command line
|-- etc
|   `-- zc.conf			# Configuration file
|-- libexec
|   `--zc
|      |-- cgi-bin
|      |   `-- zc.cgi		# CGI
|      |-- html			# HTML directory (javascript, css, pics, ...)
|      |   |-- en		#   English version
|      |   |-- ...              #   ...
|      |   `-- fr		#   French version
|      |-- locale		# Localisation files
|      |-- test			# test set
|      |-- lib			# Extra libraries (NResolv, Address, ...)
|      `-- zc			# core component
`-- share
    `-- doc
        `-- zc			# Documentation
