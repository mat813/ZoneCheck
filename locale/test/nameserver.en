        <para>A bogon prefix is a route that should never appear in the
          Internet routing table. A packet routed over the public Internet
          (not including over VPN or other tunnels) should never have a
          source address in a bogon range. These are commonly found as the
          source addresses of DDoS attacks.</para>
