[*]
connectivity_udp_tcp : [ref]: IETF RFC1035 (p.32 4.2. Transport)\nThe DNS assumes that messages will be transmitted as datagrams or in a\nbyte stream carried by a virtual circuit.  While virtual circuits can be\nused for any DNS activity, datagrams are preferred for queries due to\ntheir lower overhead and better performance.
