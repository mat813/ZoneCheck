        <para>The DNS assumes that messages will be transmitted as 
          datagrams or in a byte stream carried by a virtual circuit.
          While virtual circuits can be used for any DNS activity, 
          datagrams are preferred for queries due to their lower 
          overhead and better performance.</para>
