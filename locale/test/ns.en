ns_cname_xpl : [ref]: IETF RFC1912 (p.7)\nHaving NS records pointing to a CNAME is bad and may conflict badly\nwith current BIND servers.  In fact, current BIND implementations\nwill ignore such records, possibly leading to a lame delegation.\nThere is a certain amount of security checking done in BIND to\nprevent spoofing DNS NS records.  Also, older BIND servers reportedly\nwill get caught in an infinite query loop trying to figure out the\naddress for the aliased nameserver, causing a continuous stream of\nDNS requests to be sent.
