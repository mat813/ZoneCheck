        <para>Having NS records pointing to a CNAME is bad and may
          conflict badly with current BIND servers. In fact, current 
          BIND implementations will ignore such records, possibly leading
          to a lame delegation. There is a certain amount of security
          checking done in BIND to prevent spoofing DNS NS records.
          Also, older BIND servers reportedly will get caught in an 
          infinite query loop trying to figure out the address for the
          aliased nameserver, causing a continuous stream of DNS requests
          to be sent.</para>
