        <para>An Internet mail server performs third-party relay when
          it processes a message from a non-local sender to a non-local
          recipient. These days, junk emailers abuse this capability at
          an alarming rate. They use the stolen capacity to greatly
          increase the amount of spam they can deliver.</para>
