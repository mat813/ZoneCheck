label_xpl : [ref]: IETF RFC1034 (p.11)\nLabels are only composed by letters ([A-Za-z]), digits ([0-9]) or dashes\n('-') (not starting or ending with), and should be less than 63 characters;\ndomain name (labels separated by '.') should be less than 255 characters.\nSee also [ref]: IETF RFC1912 (2.1 Inconsistent, Missing, or Bad Data).

xpl_rfc2182 : [adv]: AFNIC\nTo avoid loosing all connectivity with the autoritative DNS in case\n of network outage it is advised to host the DNS on different networks.\nSee also IETF RFC2182.\n[ref]: IETF RFC2182 (Abstract)\nThe Domain Name System requires that multiple servers exist for every\ndelegated domain (zone).  This document discusses the selection of\nsecondary servers for DNS zones.  Both the physical and topological\nlocation of each server are material considerations when selecting\nsecondary servers.  The number of servers appropriate for a zone is\nalso discussed, and some general secondary server maintenance issues\nconsidered.



[chk_dn_sntx]
testname: illegal symbols in domain name
ok	: No illegal symbols found in domain name
error   : The domain name contains illegal symbols
explain = label_xpl


[chk_dn_orp_hyph]
testname: dash ('-') at start or beginning of domain name
ok	: No illegal use of dash ('-') in the domain name found
error   : The domain name start or end with a dash ('-')
explain = label_xpl


[chk_dn_dbl_hyph]
testname: double dash in domain name
error   : The domain name contains a double dash
ok	: No double dash ('--') found
explain : [ref]: IETF IDN project (internationalized domain names)\nThe double dash ('--') will have a special meaning for the domain name\nencoding, so it is strongly advised not to used it. See \n<URL:http://www.iana.org/cctld/specifications-policies-cctlds-01apr02.htm> (4. Tagged Domain Names.)


[chk_one_ns]
testname: one nameserver for the domain 
ok	: At least one nameserver found
error   : At least one nameserver is required
explain = xpl_rfc2182


[chk_several_ns]
testname: at least two nameservers for the domain
ok	: At least two nameservers found
error   : At least two nameservers are necessary
explain = xpl_rfc2182


[chk_ip_distinct]
testname: identical addresses
error   : All addresses should be distinct
ok	: All addresses are distinct
explain = xpl_rfc2182
details : The nameservers %{ns} are using the same IP address (%{ip}).


[chk_ip_same_net]
testname: nameserver's addresses on same subnet
error   : IP addresses on the same subnet
ok	: Some IP addresses are not on the same subnet
explain = xpl_rfc2182
details : The following subnets are used by several hosts: %{subnets}. Try moving some of their hosts to another subnet.


[chk_ip_all_same_net]
testname: nameserver addresses are all on the same subnet
error   : IP addresses are all on the same subnet
ok	: All IP addresses are not on the same subnet
explain = xpl_rfc2182
details : All the servers are in the subnet %{subnet}, try moving some of them  to another subnet.


[chk_delegation_udp512]
testname: delegation response fit in a 512 byte UDP packet
error   : Delegation response won't fit in a 512 byte UDP packet
ok      : Delagation response fit in a 512 byte UDP packet
explain : [none]
details : For a query of %{bytes} bytes, it won't be possible to send all the nameserver.


[chk_delegation_udp512_additional]
testname: delegation response with additional fit in a 512 byte UDP packet
error   : Delegation response with additional won't fit in a 512 byte UDP packet
ok      : Delagation response with additional fit in a 512 byte UDP packet
explain : [none]
details : For a query of %{bytes} bytes, it won't be possible to send all the nameserver with the corresponding glues.
