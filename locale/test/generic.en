label_xpl : [ref]: IETF RFC1034 (p.11)\nLabels are only composed by letters ([A-Za-z]), digits ([0-9]) or dashes\n('-') (not starting or ending with), and should be less than 63 characters;\ndomain name (labels separated by '.') should be less than 255 characters.

chk_several_ns_xpl : [ref]: IETF RFC2182 (Abstract)\nThe Domain Name System requires that multiple servers exist for every\ndelegated domain (zone).  This document discusses the selection of\nsecondary servers for DNS zones.  Both the physical and topological\nlocation of each server are material considerations when selecting\nsecondary servers.  The number of servers appropriate for a zone is\nalso discussed, and some general secondary server maintenance issues\nconsidered.

chk_same_net_xpl : [ref]: AFNIC advise\nTo avoid loosing all connectivity with the autoritative DNS in case\n of network outage it is advised to host the DNS on different networks. See IETF RFC2182.


[chk_dn_sntx]
testname: illegal symbols in domain name
error   : The domain name contains illegal symbols
explain = label_xpl

[chk_dn_orp_hyph]
testname: dash ('-') at start or beginning of domain name
error   : The domain name start or end with a dash ('-')
explain = label_xpl

[chk_dn_dbl_hyph]
testname: double hyphen in domain name
error   : The domain name contains a double hyphen
explain : [ref]: IETF IDN project (internationalized domain names)\nThe double dash ('--') will have a special meaning for the domain name\nencoding, so it is strongly advised not to used it. See \nhttp://www.iana.org/cctld/specifications-policies-cctlds-01apr02.htm (4. Tagged Domain Names.)


[chk_one_ns]
testname: one nameserver for the domain 
error   : At least one nameserver is requiered
explain : chk_several_ns_xpl

[chk_several_ns]
testname: at least two nameserver for the domain
error   : At least two nameserver are necessary
explain : chk_several_ns_xpl


[chk_distinct_ip]
testname: identical addresses
error   : All addresses should be distinct
explain : [none]
details : The nameservers %{ns} are using the same IP address (%{ip}). See RFC2182.


[chk_same_net]
testname: nameserver addresses on same subnet
error   : IP addresses on the same subnet
explain : chk_same_net_xpl
details : The following subnets are used by several hosts: %{subnets}. Try moving some of their hosts to another subnet.

[chk_all_same_net]
testname: nameserver addresses are all on the same subnet
error   : IP addresses are all on the same subnet
explain : chk_same_net_xpl
details : All the servers are in the subnet %{subnet}, try moving some of them  to another subnet.
