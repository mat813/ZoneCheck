ZoneCheck is copyright AFNIC, 2003. It is written and maintained by
Stephane d'Alu <sdalu@nic.fr>. You can write AFNIC at <nic@nic.fr>.

You can use, modifiy and distribute ZoneCheck according to the GPL
(GNU General Public License)
<URL:http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>. To summary (a lot!), it
means you can use ZoneCheck freely, you can have the source code, you
can distribute it freely (even after modifications) BUT you cannot
deny these freedoms to the people who receive it: for instance, you
must provide them with the source code.

Alternatively, if you want to distribute a version of ZoneCheck in a
way which is not compatible with the GPL you must get an agreement
from AFNIC which will allow you the right to use other terms.

Patch submitters are therefore informed that, for the patches to be
included, you must agree on this possible relicensing.
