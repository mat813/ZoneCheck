ZoneCheck is copyright AFNIC, 2003. It is written and maintained by
Stephane D'Alu <sdalu@nic.fr>. You can contact AFNIC at <nic@nic.fr>,
or for technical questions/patches about this software at
the following address <zonecheck@nic.fr>.

The Ruby DNS library (in the lib/ directory) is licenced like Ruby
(either GPL or the Ruby licence, see
<URL:http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/LICENSE.txt> for details).

ZoneCheck terms of use and distribution:

You can use, modify and distribute ZoneCheck according to the GPL
(GNU General Public License) <URL:http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>,
a copy has been made available in the file 'GPL'.
To summarize (a lot!), it means you can use ZoneCheck freely (but not
to link it with software which is not GPL-compatible), you can have 
the source code, you can distribute it freely (even after modifications)
BUT you cannot deny these freedoms to the people who receive it: for
instance, you must provide them with the source code.

Alternatively, if you want to use or distribute a version of ZoneCheck
in a way which is not compatible with the GPL you *must* get an
agreement from AFNIC which will give you the right to use the
following terms. The license is therefore *not* a disjunctive
license. To use the "MIT/X11"-like license hereafter, you need a
personal agreement with AFNIC.
